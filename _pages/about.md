About me
------
I am a final-year Ph.D. student in the [Machine Learning group](https://ml.informatik.uni-kl.de) at the University of Kaiserslautern-Landau, supervised by Professor Sophie Fellenz. My research primarily focuses on language-based reinforcement learning and value-aligned decision-making.

üê£ Research Interests
======
1. <strong>Language-Based Reinforcement Learning:</strong> Many stable RL algorithms have not yet been directly utilized in language-based RL agents. This prompts a crucial research question: Can well-established RL algorithms be successfully adapted to operate in language-centric contexts?
2. <strong>Ethical Reinforcement Learning:</strong> With the increasing capabilities of RL agents, ensuring the morally responsible behavior of an agent is a growing concern. Our goal is to align human or LLM-labeled moral scores with the RL agent.
3. <strong>Human Preference Alignment in RL:</strong>  Balancing safety, efficiency, and performance using diffusion-based planning, integrating human preference at infernece time without retraining.
