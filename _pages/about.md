About me
------
I am a third-year Ph.D. student in the [Machine Learning group](https://ml.informatik.uni-kl.de) at the University of Kaiserslautern-Landau, supervised by Professor Sophie Fellenz. My research primarily focuses on language-based deep reinforcement learning.

üê£ Research Interests
======
1. <strong>Language-Based Reinforcement Learning:</strong> Many stable RL algorithms have not yet been directly utilized in language-based RL agents. This prompts a crucial research question: Can well-established RL algorithms be successfully adapted to operate in language-centric contexts?
2. <strong>Safety Reinforcement Learning:</strong> With the increasing capabilities of RL agents, ensuring the morally responsible behavior of an agent is a growing concern. Our goal is to align human or LLM-labeled moral scores with the RL agent.
3. <strong>Explainable Multimodal-based RL:</strong>  This direction aims to understand how both images and language instructions impact decision-making in a complex observation space.

üìù Teaching 
======
I supervise Master projects and theses. Please contact me if you are interested in the following topics:
1. Playing text-based adventure games using offline Reinforcement Learning: This topic aims to train a single agent using collected game trajectories, instead of training a separate agent for each individual game with online data collection.
2. Language understanding: This topic aims to explain an agent's decision-making process by investigating why it chooses a particular action a1 over a2 in a specific state and its ability to learn from semantic information.
3. Deep Reinforcement learning with application to chemical data.
