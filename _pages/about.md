üêª About me
------
I am a third-year Ph.D. student in the Machine Learning group at the University of Kaiserslautern-Landau, supervised by Professor [Sophie Fellenz](https://ml.informatik.uni-kl.de/people/sophie-burkhardt.php). My research primarily focuses on language-based deep reinforcement learning.

üê£ Research Interests
======
1. Language-Based Reinforcement Learning
2. Safety Reinforcement Learning


üê• Publications
======
1. W. Li, R. Devidze, W. Mustafa, and S. Fellenz.(2024) Ethics in Action: Training Reinforcement Learning Agent for Moral Decision-making In Text-based Adventure Games. (To appear)Proceedings of International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics (AISTATS)
2. W. Li, R. Devidze, S. Fellenz.(2023) Learning to play text-based adventure games with maximum entropy reinforcement learning. European Conference on Machine Learning and Data Mining (ECML PDKK)
3. W. Li.et.al.(2022),Topic-Guided Knowledge Graph Construction for Argument Mining. IEEE International Conference on Big Knowledge(ICBK)



üìù Teaching 
======
I supervise Master projects and theses. Please reach out if you are interested in the following topics:
1. Playing text-based adventure games using offline Reinforcement Learning: This topic aims to train a single agent using collected game trajectories, instead of training a separate agent for each individual game with online data collection.
2. Language understanding: This topic aims to explain an agent's decision-making process by investigating why it chooses a particular action a1 over a2 in a specific state and its ability to learn from semantic information.
3. Deep Reinforcement learning with application to chemical data.
