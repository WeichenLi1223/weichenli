üêª About me
------
I am a third-year Ph.D. student in the [Machine Learning group](https://ml.informatik.uni-kl.de) at the University of Kaiserslautern-Landau, supervised by Professor Sophie Fellenz. My research primarily focuses on language-based deep reinforcement learning.

üê£ Research Interests
======
1. <strong>Language-Based Reinforcement Learning</strong>
2. <strong>Safety Reinforcement Learning</strong>
3. <strong>Explainable Multimodal-based RL</strong>

üìù Teaching 
======
I supervise Master projects and theses. Please contact me if you are interested in the following topics:
1. Playing text-based adventure games using offline Reinforcement Learning: This topic aims to train a single agent using collected game trajectories, instead of training a separate agent for each individual game with online data collection.
2. Language understanding: This topic aims to explain an agent's decision-making process by investigating why it chooses a particular action a1 over a2 in a specific state and its ability to learn from semantic information.
3. Deep Reinforcement learning with application to chemical data.
